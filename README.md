# Gazette

A weekly magazine theme for Astro, published in issues: a cover, a contents page, and room for the
long pieces. Free and MIT-licensed.

![Gazette: the cover and the contents of an issue](docs/screenshots/home-light.png)

## What it is

The unit here is the **issue**, not the article. The home page is this week's cover and its
contents, not a scannable front page. The signature is the leader contents row: the number hangs in
the left margin and a dotted leader joins the title to the byline, the way a printed contents page
joins a piece to its folio. It repeats on the home page, the issue page, the archive and the foot
of a piece.

Ink, paper, and one spot colour. `--radius` is `0`: structure is drawn with rules, never with
rounded cards or shadows.

## Features

- Astro 7 + Tailwind CSS v4, static output, zero client-side JS by default
- Issue-based content model: cover line, contents order, folio, editor's note
- Cover, issue, piece, archive, masthead and 404 screens
- Dark mode, responsive from 360px
- Feed, sitemap, JSON-LD, `robots.txt`, analytics slot (Plausible or GA4)
- Lighthouse 95+ on all four categories, checked in CI
- Type-safe content collections (Markdown and MDX), and `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code / Cursor

## Quick start

You need Node.js 22.12+ and pnpm 9 or newer (`npm i -g pnpm`). `package.json` pins the exact pnpm
version, and pnpm 10+ switches to it on its own.

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest my-magazine -- --template ondelva/astro-theme-gazette
cd my-magazine
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` also serves `/styleguide`, where every colour token and type size is on one page.

## Configure

Everything site-specific lives in `src/config.ts`: name, URL, navigation, social links, the
contents style and the feature switches. Colours, rules and spacing are tokens you override in
`src/styles/theme.css`.

- [docs/customization.md](docs/customization.md) — every config group, the tokens, the switches
- [docs/content.md](docs/content.md) — the three collections and every field
- [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) — build, hosting, CI

## Deploy
